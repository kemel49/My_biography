    <p>I am a newbie to this world (üñ•Ô∏è+üåç).it is no more than three months since i join to learn programming from scratch.</p>
    <p>My first goal was to master HTML+CSS+JS, but (un)fortunately my teacher,who held Javascript class once in month,has passed away<br>due to which i had to leave JS aside and focus on remaining courses.However,The new appointed teacher is an experienced one as she works in sillicon valley of Kannadaland.</p>
